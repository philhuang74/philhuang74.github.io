Here is an example of an Analysis problem. 

#### Problem I:

Let $$E \subset {\mathbb{R}}$$ be a non-empty set of real numbers which is
bounded above. When $$a > 0$$ is a positive real number, let us set
$$aE = \{ax; x \in E \}.$$ Prove that the set $$aE$$ is bounded above and
that $$\sup aE = a \sup E.$$

Let $$E \subset {\mathbb{R}}$$ be a non-empty set of real numbers which is
bounded above. When $$a > 0$$ is a positive real number, let us set
$$aE = \{ax; x \in E \}.$$ Since $$E$$ is bounded above, there exists a
least upper bound of $$E$$ such that $$x \leq \sup E$$ $$\quad \forall x \in E$$. By
multiplying $$a$$ to both sides of the inequality, $$ax \leq a\sup E$$
$$\quad \forall x \in E$$. Therefore, $$a \sup E$$ is the upper bound of $$aE$$,
which implies that $$aE$$ is bounded above. With $$\sup aE$$ being the least
upper bound of $$aE$$, the upper bound $$a \sup E$$ must be greater than or
equal to $$\sup aE$$. Hence, $$\sup aE \leq a\sup E.$$ Given that $$aE$$ is
bounded above, there exists a least upper bound for $$aE$$ where
$$ax \leq \sup aE$$ $$\quad \forall ax \in aE$$. If we algebraically manipulate
the inequality, $$ax \leq \sup aE$$
$$x \leq \frac{\sup aE}{a} \quad \forall x \in E,$$ which means that
$$\frac{\sup aE}{a}$$ is the upper bound of $$E$$. With $$\sup E$$ being the
least upper bound of $$E$$, $$\sup E \leq \frac{\sup aE}{a}.$$ Therefore,
if we multiply $$a$$ to both sides of the inequality,
$$a \sup E \leq \sup aE.$$ Since $$\sup aE \leq a\sup E$$ and
$$a\sup E \leq \sup aE$$, $$\sup aE = a\sup E.$$
