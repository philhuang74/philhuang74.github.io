title: Minimum Sum Path (LeetCode 64)
---

Given a m x n grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right, which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.

Note: You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

Here is the grid we will consider


```python
grid = [[1,3,1],[1,5,1],[4,2,1]]
print('\n'.join([''.join(['{:4}'.format(item) for item in row])for row in grid]))
```

       1   3   1
       1   5   1
       4   2   1


The approach is to use dynamic programming. Lets assume at each cell of matrix, we have the minimum path sum to get to that block. Since we can only move down or right, that means the minimum path sum comes from either the left block or the block avove plus the block's cost. We know the cost of a block is fixed. That is why we are adding that grid number with the minimum of the minimum sum path that was calculated from the left or upper block.

The matrix minPathSum will be a matrix of size (rows of grid) + 1 by (columns of grid) + 1. We will set the boundaries to infinity, since we want to find the minimum. We will set the matrix at index 0,1 to be 0 to get the process going. This will make sure that the first block which we start from, which is the matrix at index 1,1 (the starting point) will get 0 + grid value at index 0,0. 


```python
class Solution:
    def minPathSum(self, grid) -> int:
        minPathSum = [[float("inf") for _ in range(len(grid[0])+1)] for _ in range(len(grid)+1)]
        minPathSum[0][1] = 0
        for i in range(1,len(minPathSum)):
            for j in range(1,len(minPathSum[0])):
                minPathSum[i][j]=grid[i-1][j-1]+min(minPathSum[i-1][j],minPathSum[i][j-1])
        print('\n'.join([''.join(['{:4}'.format(item) for item in row])for row in minPathSum]))
        return minPathSum[-1][-1]
```

The runtime of this algorithm is O(nm) for m rows and n columns.


```python
sol = Solution()
```


```python
sol.minPathSum(grid)
```

     inf   0 inf inf
     inf   1   4   5
     inf   2   7   6
     inf   6   8   7





    7



Our minimum sum path seems to be 7 to get from top left block to bottom right block.

Now we want to use traceback to find the path on the grid that led to the minimum sum path.


```python
def minPathSumMatrix(grid):
    matrix = [[float("inf") for _ in range(len(grid[0])+1)] for _ in range(len(grid)+1)]
    matrix[0][1] = 0
    for i in range(1,len(matrix)):
        for j in range(1,len(matrix[0])):
            matrix[i][j]=grid[i-1][j-1]+min(matrix[i-1][j],matrix[i][j-1])
    return matrix
```


```python
matrix = minPathSumMatrix(grid)
matrix
```




    [[inf, 0, inf, inf], [inf, 1, 4, 5], [inf, 2, 7, 6], [inf, 6, 8, 7]]




```python
path = []
```


```python
m = n = len(grid)
path.append(grid[m-1][n-1]) #This is the destination of the path
```


```python
while not (m==1 and n==1): #while we haven't reached the first block
    if matrix[m-1][n] < matrix[m][n-1]: #if the upper block is smaller, append the grid cost on to path
        path.append(grid[(m-1)-1][n-1]) 
        m -= 1
    else: #else, the left block is smaller, append the grid cost on to path
        path.append(grid[m-1][(n-1)-1])
        n -= 1
```

Using traceback, we now have a list path that is reverse of the actual path


```python
path
```




    [1, 1, 1, 3, 1]



By reversing the path, we get the minimum sum path taken.


```python
[e for e in reversed(path)]
```




    [1, 3, 1, 1, 1]
