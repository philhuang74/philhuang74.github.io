Today, we are going to create some decision regions on the penguins dataset. We are also going to produce some graphs with seaborn.

First, lets import some of the main packages needed in this visualization

```python
import pandas as pd #import the needed packages
import seaborn as sns
import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
```

Next, lets download the penguins data frame.

```python
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/palmer_penguins.csv" #download dataset and view dataframe
penguins = pd.read_csv(url)
penguins
```
