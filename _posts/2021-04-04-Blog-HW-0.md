Today, we are going to create some decision regions on the penguins dataset. We are also going to produce some graphs with seaborn

```python
import pandas as pd #import the needed packages
import seaborn as sns
import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
```

```python
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/palmer_penguins.csv" #download dataset and view dataframe
penguins = pd.read_csv(url)
penguins
```
